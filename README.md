# Getting Started with Create React App

I used React.js to implement the task

The data of the created trips are stored in the firebase realtime database,
and authentication is performed using firebase auth (Google)

From additional functions:
- deleting trips (by clicking on the cross on the trip card)
- adaptive layout
- On the travel cards, corresponding labels are displayed, which show that the journey has already started or ended
